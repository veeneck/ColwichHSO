For larger requests, we love ideas that benefit the whole school! Think bigâ€”past projects include bleachers, furniture for The Nest, and our school beautification fund. These long-lasting improvements are fueled by Coin Wars, our biggest fundraiser, where we set goals for major items. Got a grand idea? Share it with us and consider pitching it at an [HSO meeting](/meetings/)!
