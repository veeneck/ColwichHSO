question: What do you look for in field trip, party & other requests?

We’re thrilled to support field trips, special events, or items that benefit the whole school! The amount HSO can approve depends on available funds. Things like admission or mileage are easier to cover, while less healthy food items are trickier, but not impossible. For example, if a class hasn’t used any funds, we’d love to help with something fun like an end-of-year pizza party if we can! Every request is unique and reviewed case by case to maximize benefits for the kids. If we can’t approve something, we’ll let you know, and you may need to ask parents to chip in for the difference.

Got big ideas for pricier projects that could benefit the whole school for years? Share them with us! They might be perfect for an upcoming Coin Wars fundraiser.
