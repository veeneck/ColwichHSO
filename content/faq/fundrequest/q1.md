question: What does HSO look for in funding requests?

We’re thrilled to support field trips, special events, or items that benefit the whole school! 

Each request is different, and approval will reflect HSO’s operating budget for the given year. The most common types of requests are:

**Field Trips**

1-2 per grade are easiest to approve, covering admission or mileage. Parents may need to chip in for meals or treats. 

**Classroom / Office Supplies**

Classroom supplies are another popular request! We love to help with these, but the amount we can cover will depend on our budget and the class’s prior requests. 

**Parties**

While food requests are generally not prioritized, they may be a good fit for classrooms that do not take field trips. If a class hasn’t used any funds, we’d love to help with something special if we can! 

Every request is unique and reviewed case by case to maximize benefits for the kids. If we can’t approve something, we’ll let you know and suggest ways parents might help cover the difference.
