question: How much is available to each teacher per year?

We don’t have a set dollar amount per teacher because our budget varies each year based on fundraising and the number of requests. 

But don’t let that stop you! Share your ideas, and we’ll work to fund them fully, partially, or help you find other resources.

Please note: Any single or cumatilve classroom request over $500 will require a vote from all HSO members, and should aim to benefit the entire school.
