question: What do you look for in classroom item requests?

We’re excited to make classroom shopping easier! Each teacher gets $200 from the school, and we match it, giving you $400 to spruce up your classroom with decorations, books, project supplies, or anything physical that helps your students thrive. If you need more than $400, it’s tough for us to approve, as we need to save funds for all teachers and focus on items that benefit the whole school. But if you have a special request that could impact multiple classes or last for years at CES, please send it our way! Just know it’ll go through a careful review.
