Approving a fund request usually looks like this:

- Submit your request using the form above.
- Youâ€™ll hear back within a week about the status of your request.
- HSO officers will vote on your request at the next [quarterly meeting](/meetings/) or fast-track it if needed.
- Requests over $500 need a vote from all HSO members. 

<br />

If a vote was not possible, or if more information is needed, your request will be discussed at the next [quarterly HSO meeting](/meetings/). We encourage you to attend to share your idea!

Please [contact us](/forms/contactus/) or reach out to an [officer]((/meetings/#section3)) if you have not heard anything regarding your request.
