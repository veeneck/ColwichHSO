Donations go back to the school in a variety of forms. Field trips, supplies and teacher appreciation are examples of recurring expenses. We also save towards larger expenses. In recent years, we have purchased a new sound system for the school, and the digital marquee out front. We greatly appreciate any donation you have to offer. If you're interested, please [read more about it here](/donate).
