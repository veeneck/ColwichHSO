The community has gotten together to put on a fun, family-friendly event where you can participate in a candy cane hunt in the park at 5:00 pm followed by games, crafts, treates and more.  Over in the REC, you can get pictures and visit with Santa Claus!  There will also be a kids cookie contest, so bring in your best decorated cookie for judging by 6:00.
