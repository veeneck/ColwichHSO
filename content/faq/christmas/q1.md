The community has gotten together to put on a fun, family-friendly event where you can participate in a candy cane hunt in the park at 5:00 pm followed by caroling and the tree lighting.  Then, head on over to the REC where you can get pictures and visit with Santa Claus!  There will also be crafts, treats and more!
