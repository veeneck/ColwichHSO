Each year, we collect feedback and try to slightly change Carnival for the better. This year, we're adding in an attraction for the middle schoolers (Velcro Wall), making the Raffle ticket process easier, and adding in more food options. We've also refreshed a few of the games and are bringing in the obstacle course bounce house.
