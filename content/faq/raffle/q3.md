There are a few ways to get the most out of a Raffle Donation:

- The Raffle Tables and Donor Wall are placed in the main hall of the school, so all Carnival attendees will walk through it.
- We're hopeful for **500 - 750** people to attend Carnival this year.
- The average visitor to the Raffle website stays for over **5** minutes, so they are highly engaged.
- Prizes that enourage the winner to visit your business are a way to gain expsoure to new customers.
