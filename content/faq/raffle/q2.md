Donations go back to the school in a variety of forms. Field trips, supplies and teacher appreciation are examples of recurring expenses. We also save towards larger expenses. In recent years, we have purchased a new sound system for the school, and the digital marquee out front. We are 100% volunteer run, so all funds make their way to the school.
