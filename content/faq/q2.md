HSO provides funding for important educational equipment, class field trips and teacher & staff appreciation events. We also support school projects that lack extra resources. Outside of fundriasing, we sponsor fun events like [Coffee with Cardinals](/coffee), [Ice Cream Social](/dessert), [Veteranâ€™s Day Program](/veteransday), [Spring Carnival](/carnival) and so on. In the 2021-22 school year, we funded over **$9,000**, and welcomed over 100 volunteers.
