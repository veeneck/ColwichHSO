HSO provides funding for important educational equipment, class field trips and teacher & staff appreciation events. We also support school projects that lack extra resources. Outside of fundriasing, we sponsor fun events like Coffee with Cardinals, Ice Cream Social, Veteranâ€™s Day Program, Carnival etc. In the 2021-22 school year, we funded over **$9,000**, and managed over 100 volunteers.
