Once the calendar is installed, removing it is done like any other calendar on your device. You would go to your calendar applicaiton, and delete the calendar. Examples for a few common devices are:

[Add or Delete Calendar on MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/add-or-delete-calendars-icl1005/mac)

[Delete a Calendar on Android](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37188?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=0#zippy=%2Cdelete-a-calendar-cant-be-undone)

On iPhone or iPad, you can:

1. Open the Calendar app.
2. At the bottom of the screen, tap Calendars.
3. Look for a calendar that you wish to delete. Tap the More Info button next to that calendar, then scroll down and tap Delete Calendar.
