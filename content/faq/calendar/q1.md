By clicking the Add to Your Calendar button at the top of this page, you will be prompted to download and install the shared calendar. Once clicking, you will be asked to allow the download, and to click a "Subscribe" button. You may also be asked to choose which of your accounts the calendar should live under. Once you go through the simple prompts, the calendar is installed. 

If you prefer to do this manually, the link to our shared calendar is:
