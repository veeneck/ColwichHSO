**On ï£¿ Apple and Windows Products**

By clicking the Add to Your Calendar button at the top of this page, you will be prompted to download and install the shared calendar. Once clicking, you will be asked to allow the download, and to click a "Subscribe" button. You may also be asked to choose which of your accounts the calendar should live under. Once you go through the simple prompts, the calendar is installed. 

**To Your Google Account**

You can [add the calendar directly to your Google Account](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/r396gjmq9slavbd7qt8b1bd288%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). After clicking that link, and signing into Google, you will be prompted with an "Add" button. Accept that, and you are subscribed to the calendar.

**On Android or other devices that do not support webcal**

If your Android device uses your Google account, refer to the step above. For other devices, you can manually add the calendar. Just look for a "Subscribe to Calendar" option in your calendar app, and then paste the link below:
