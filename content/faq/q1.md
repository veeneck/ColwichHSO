**H**ome and **S**chool **O**rganization -- we work just like a PTA!  The organization is made up of parents and teachers whose main goal is to provide better communication and cooperation between the home and school. We also facilitate fundraising to help cover a variety of school expenses, and to raise funds towards larger school improvement projects.
