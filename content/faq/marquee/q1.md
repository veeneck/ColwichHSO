For a fee that benefits the school and HSO, you can place a message on the marquee in front of the school. This is an opportunity to recognize a student's birthday, show school spirit, thank or recognize a teacher or staff member, congratulatory events, etc. on the schoolâ€™s digital marquee sign.  It is a great way to spread positive messages and increase excitement in our community!
