So that you can play an active role in your childâ€™s school life!  Being an HSO volunteer is one way to say thank you to the school staff for guiding our children on a daily basis.  We truly need every parent to pitch in. Membership is open to any parent or guardian of children enrolled in CES or anyone in the Renwick school district interested in the purposes of the organization. There are only 4 meetings a year!  [Please consider attending.](/meetings)

Remember- NO ONE can do everything but EVERYONE can do something.
