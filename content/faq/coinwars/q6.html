<p>You can donate by giving your child coins, bills, or checks (payable to Colwich HSO) that they can bring in any day for the week of March 9th-13th. They will put it into their class&#8217;s container each morning. There is also an option to <a href="https://colwichhso.wufoo.com/forms/coin-war-2026">donate online</a>. So you can ask people near or far!</p>
