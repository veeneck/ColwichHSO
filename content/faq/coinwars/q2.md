This game is simple. It is basically a competition to see which class can raise the most money.  Since class sizes vary, the classes will compete to get the highest average amount per student. Each day the money will be counted and there will be a traveling trophy for the class in the lead.  There will be prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place.  As well as, a school wide prize if we meet our $2500 goal.
