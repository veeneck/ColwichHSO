This game is simple. It is basically a competition to see which class can raise the most money.  Since class sizes vary, the classes will compete to get the highest average amount per student. Each day the money will be counted and there will be a traveling trophy for the class in the lead.  There will be prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. Additionally, there will be school wide prizes that are unlocked when fundraising milestones are reached, and daily winners for classes that do the best on individual days!
