Last year, HSO funded over $3,200 on school field trips, fulfilled more than $3,800 of teacher funding requests, and even organized 6 awesome events. Through our Coin Wars fundraiser, we helped to revamp The Nest! In total, HSO gave more than $14,000 back to Colwich Elementary School. This year, weâ€™re thinking about making our school even more beautiful. In addition to the yearly ways in which we help the school, your Coin Wars donations will be used on various campus beautification projects!
