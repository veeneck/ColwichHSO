You can donate by giving your child coins, bills, or checks (payable to Colwich HSO) that they can bring in any day for the week of Macrh 4th-8th. They will put it into their class's container each morning. There is also an option to donate online at colwichhso.com/coinwars. So you can ask people near or far!
