You can donate by giving your child coins, bills, or checks (payable to Colwich HSO) that they can bring in any day for the week of March 10th-14th. They will put it into their class's container each morning. There is also an option to [donate online](https://colwichhso.wufoo.com/forms/coin-war-2025). So you can ask people near or far!
