Donations go back to the school in a variety of forms. Field trips, supplies and teacher appreciation are examples of recurring expenses. We also save towards larger expenses. In past years, we have finished The Nest (student lounge) and started a school beautification project. We have also saved for bleachers, sound systems, and a new school playground.
