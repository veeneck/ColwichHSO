Donations go back to the school in a variety of forms. Field trips, supplies and teacher appreciation are examples of recurring expenses. We also save towards larger expenses. In recent years, we have purchased a new sound system for the school, and the digital marquee out front. Currently, we're fundraising for The Nest, which is a recreation room on campus for the students.
