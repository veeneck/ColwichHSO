Our print options refer to Carnival and other in person events. If you're the sponsor of an additional HSO with adults attending, your banner will be on display there as well. Otherwise, depending on your package, the print benefits will be a combinaiton of the following:

- Your name on the print banner with other Text Package sponsors.
- Your logo on the logo banner with other Logo Package sponsors.
- Your logo on flags lining the Carnival entrance.
- Your logo on a dedicated banner to be displayed in a high traffic area during Carnival.
- Your logo on a pedestal in front of a game or activity that you are sponsoring.
- Your name or logo on print marketing materials like flyers, maps, and other Carnival promotions.
