<p>We&#8217;re appreciative of any support you can give. Whether your donation is less than $100, or more than $5,000, we will do our best to accomodate you. For lower donations, we will include you on a sponsors page of our website. For larger donors, we would love to talk about ways we can help. Examples can be increased promotion, physical landmarks, and so on.</p>
